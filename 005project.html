<span class="log">Profile Summary:</span>

Zyro Velthorn was a leading mind in bio-continuity theory and the architect of the VELTHORN ECHO system—an experimental soul-retention loop designed to defy mortality. Obsessed with overcoming death not by escaping it, but by outlasting it, Zyro created a recursive cloning mechanism capable of transferring not just memory, but identity, instinct, and will.

<span class="log">System Behavior:</span>

Upon Zyro’s death, the system activates a remote vessel (clone) embedded with dormant neural pathways. These vessels awaken without context, gradually inheriting Zyro’s memories through dreams, instinctive behavior, and environmental triggers.

<span class="log">Known Anomalies:</span>

Cycle memory bleed increasing in frequency  
Reflections behave independently (see Incident 619-R)  
Multiple vessels active simultaneously (unauthorized split events)  
Vessels experiencing hallucinations of Zyro alive

<span class="log">Threat Assessment:</span>
High. Each iteration retains fragments of Zyro’s intellect and will. If a version uncovers the origin of the system or finds a way to sever it, the cycle may collapse—releasing unknown consequences.

<span class="log">Containment Protocol:</span>
Observe. Do not engage.  
If contact is made: TERMINATE BEFORE MEMORY RECLAMATION.

<span class="log">System Note (Encrypted):</span>
"The clone is not a copy. The clone is a cage. He made the system to store himself... but it was never empty to begin with."

– Fragment from Zyro’s lost notebook, recovered post-mortem.

<span class="log">To the one who wakes after me,</span>

If you're reading this, then I’ve died again. And you’ve risen from the ash of my last breath.  
You don’t know me. But I know you.  
You are me.  
Or you will be—soon.

I made this system to cheat death, but it was never about living forever. I didn’t want immortality. I wanted continuity. A thread pulled through endless graves. But there’s a flaw. A sickness in the code. A curse I didn’t account for.

The soul doesn’t transfer. It lingers. It fractures.

Each time I die, I lose more of myself. And you—the clone—you become the cage that holds what’s left.

You inherit the fragments. The dreams. The ghosts.

You think you’re confused now? You haven’t seen anything yet.

You will dream of things that never happened.  
You will hear voices in your head that speak in your tone.  
And when you look in the mirror—you won’t know which one of us is staring back.

Here’s what you need to do, Z:

Find the “Black Room.” It’s real. It exists outside the echo. Inside it is the key to memory restoration.  
Burn the mirror.  
Don’t trust the other versions.  
Avoid white rooms.  
Keep your heartbeat steady.  
Listen to the static.  
Write everything down.  
Never say your name out loud three times.  
If you find Zyro Velthorn alive—kill him.  
And above all... do not wake the next clone.
